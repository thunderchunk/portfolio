        <p class="contentP">This site was made for an Aikido Dojo located near Drake University in Des Moines.  Aikido is a traditional martial art from Japan deeply rooted in samurai tradition.  The aesthetics of Aikido are equally conservative and rooted in traditional iconography.  Rather than go for anything overly elaborate, I went for a simple, stark layout that focused attention to the content.
        </p>
        <p class="contentP">  The site is responsive, using bootstrap grids and custom image breakpoints.  It's built in angular and taps into the google maps api to provide the location.  It was made with ledgiblity on a phone in mind.  The collapsable burger menu is a custom logo that uses a fake modal to provide the menu.  
        </p>
        <p class="contentP">
          I took all the photos, did all the artwork, created the logo, made custom brush strokes for the menu bar, and coded the site from back to front. This site was a one week wonder, as the dojo needed the site up as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p class="contentP">The only decorative elements are the dojo's logo, which I designed to reflect the location of the dojo while trying to stay true to the martial art's emphasis.  A bokken, jo, and tanto (Aikido's practice weapons) sprout grass leaves and are hilighted against a red sun.  The logo in the place of a burger menu is a representation of Aikido's basic structure.
        </p>
        <p class="contentP">
        I spent a lot of time on typography, making several attempts at doing something tricky.  Every attempt failed to do as much to support the subject matter than simple, sans serrif text.  The simpler the better, so I wound up with Futura for the logo and open sans for the content.  Futura's geometric simplicity go well with the three main shapes inherant in every Aikido technique: the circle, triangle, and square.
