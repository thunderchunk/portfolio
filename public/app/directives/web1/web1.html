        <p class="contentP">The client is a startup brewer in Carlisle, Iowa. He needed a corporate identity, packaging, logos, and an overall aesthetic for his company. His business was originally located in the basement of his house on a gravel road, hence Back Road Brewery.
        </p>
        <p class="contentP">
            After meeting with him over a few beers, we hashed out the overall look of the brand. He wanted something rustic with trucks as a theme. I’m always up for a good trip to a new brewery, and have a large label collection. We went over his competition and landed on something different for his boutique, central Iowa market. Iowa beer labels run the gamut from pinup models, photography, 1950’s style illustrations, and simple vector design, so we decided on single color illustrations based on chalk
            signage artwork. Each label is a different earthy color with a simple, one color print.

        <p class="contentP">
            We carried this over to his company logo, his business cards, and even his marketing materials, all of which are printed on some form of card stock.
        </p>
        <p class="contentP">
            For the site, we opted for something clean and photographic. His emphasis was on a laptop or an iPad, so we made something large and lush for that market, but ensured it was still easy to navigate on a phone.
        </p>
        <p class="contentP">
            I used AngularJS, Node, JQuery, Javascript, SCSS, HTML, Bootstrap, Ui-Router, and the Google Maps API. Because the client hasn't finalized his distribution locations, they're not included on the public site, but you can find it <a href="http://www.backroadbeer.com/#/secretLocations">here</a>.
