        <p class="contentP">I made this site using Shopify the year before I decided to learn to become a web developer. Using their template, my partner and I set up our own stock art store. Although the site's skeleton is based on a Shopify template, I made extensive modifications.
        </p>
        <p class="contentP">The site is predominantly white and as minimal as possible, in order to let the artwork be the star. I stripped off everything flashy, animated, or distracting in deference to an austere look.
        </p>
        <p class="contentP">
        I tweaked the slideshow using some Jquery.  We changed it from an obnoxious wipe to a simple fade.

        <div class="contentImgRight" id="web5b"></div>
        <p class="contentP">
          I was chiefly responsible for content. We've got over five thousand pieces of artwork, each with 6 images, downloadable files, supplementary materials, copywriting, and links to up-sells and instructional blogs.
        </p>
        <p class="contentP">
            The blogs range from vintage artwork <a href="http://www.bruiserart.com/blogs/blog/54608321-vintage-u-of-i-program-reference-photos">inspiration</a> to <a href="http://www.bruiserart.com/blogs/blog/17153185-screen-printing-tutorial-2-gradients"> detailed instructions</a> on screenprint separation done the Aididas way.  Lots of mom and pop shops that are our customers didn't have a single place to gather information on the best printing methods.  Even the Specialty Graphic Imaging Association lacks a single repository of knowledge.  Most places either grow content with their own systems, guard their methods as industrial secrets, or have a few skilled employees that don't share the information.  I provided high quality vector artwork, and the instructions on how to print them.
