        <p class="contentP">The client is a local restaurant in Carlisle, Iowa.  They're a barbecue joint with a rustic feel, and the site had to match.
        </p>
        <p class="contentP">
            Barn wood, beer, and smoked meat were the basis for the  site's look.  Initially, I built a site with an ordering system that would allow the customer to choose from the menu, pick options, make custom choices, and add them to a "bag".  It's  a cart, but since the carryout business is done using paper bags, I thought it'd be cute.
        </p>
        <div class="contentImgRight" id="web2f"></div>
        <p class="contentP">
            The custom orders were built to go into an email account, which would be displayed on a tablet in the kitchen. After building the system, the customer decided that with their current quantity of orders, an online ordering system would be like trying to drink from a firehose.  They decided against online ordering, luckily before I went through the work of connecting Square to the system.  
        </p>
        <p class="contentP">
            Since the online ordering portion of the site was nixed, we went with a straight up brochure site.  
        </p>
        <p class="contentP">
            I used AngularJS, Node, JQuery, Javascript, SCSS, HTML, Bootstrap, Ui-Router, and the Google Maps API. </a>
